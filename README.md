##### Impact of COVID-19 on the environment
We create an interactive website for people to recognize the importance of social distancing to prevent COVID-19.

#### Motivation

We wanted to research the impact of Covid-19. Our goal was to provide a useful app that can help in our understanding of Covid-19 and its impact on society. Being a worldwide issue we set out with the motivation to help as many people as possible, through a user friendly and educational apppication.

#### Usefulness

Our project has two important objectives that are worth mentioning. One being the prediction model, that is used to predict the trend in Covid-19 cases over the next 3 days. The second being an analysis of GPS searches worldwide, to see where people are traveling to during lockdown. 
Both of these implementations provide a greater insight into how Covid-19 is impacting the community. Our hope is that people will use the application to stay aware of Covid-19 in their community.
